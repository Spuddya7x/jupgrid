## Installation üîß

Install Jupgrid with npm:

```
npm install -g @spuddya7x/jupgrid
```

## Usage üöÄ

1. **Initial Setup:** Run Jupgrid for the first time to create the necessary user configuration files:

```
    node .
```

This will generate a `.env` file where you will fill in your secure data.

2. **Configuration:** Open the `.env` file in a text editor and input your Phantom wallet Private Key, and the URL to your RPC.

3. **Run Jupgrid:** Start Jupgrid again with `node .` to launch the bot. Upon startup, you will be prompted to enter the following parameters:
   
    - Token A:
    - Token B:
    - Size (In Token A):
    - Spread (% difference from current market price to orders):

   Jupgrid will then place one buy and one sell order based on the parameters you have set.

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

The `.env` file will need to contain your API keys and other sensitive information. Ensure you fill it out before running the bot for the second time:

- `RPC_URL`=YourRPCURLHere
- `PRIVATE_KEY`=YourPrivateKeyHere
- `Other configurations as necessary`

There will also be a `userData` file created. This will contain data on the parameters you set during setup.
